		<h2 class="center">Testing Grape Mass Distribution for Three Populations of Grapes</h2><br />

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>Grapes in grocery stores are packaged, priced, and sold in units of mass, as this is the easiest, most economical, and most sensible way for the grocers to price and partition organic stock. It is also sensible in the majority of cases for consumers to purchase their produce by mass. Were this not the case, we would no doubt see a greater focus in the industry in counting and quantifying numbers of discrete produce units. However, this universal strategy for grape distribution presents a problem in the unique case that one wishes to acquire a precise number of grapes. One occaison for doing this is in preparation for the New Year's tradition of eating 12 grapes at midnight on New Year&apos;s Day with the supperstition that the consumer will incur good luck in the coming year. The New-Year&apos;s-party host is tasked with purchasing a precise quanitity of grapes \(N_{grapes} = N_{guests}\cdot 12\). In this experiment, we examine the potential feasibility of estimating the size of a population of grapes based on the Gross Population Mass (GPM) and the challenges presented in attempting this in practice.
