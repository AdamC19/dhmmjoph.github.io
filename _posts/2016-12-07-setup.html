<h2>Computer</h2>
<p>
	My primary computer is a "Mid 2015" 15 inch MacBook Pro (model <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook_pro/specs/macbook-pro-core-i7-2.5-15-dual-graphics-mid-2015-retina-display-specs.html">MJLT2LL/A</a>), with a 2.5 GHz Intel Core i7,
	16 GB of memory, and a 512 GB SSD. I have nothing against Windows as an operating system
	or most PC laptops, but my requirements for a laptop include something reasonably light,
	with a solid chassis, great keyboard and trackpad, and the ability to run a UNIX-like OS
	out of the box. The only non-Apple system I'm aware of that meets these requirements is
	the Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, but it isn't really cheaper than equivalent MacBooks,
	I want something a little bigger than 15 inches, and I prefer macOS to Ubuntu anyway.
	I do run Windows on the MacBook from time to time, to do the few things I can't do
	under macOS.

<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>
	My cell phone is a 64 GB Space Grey iPhone 6S. I usually use this in comjunction with an Apple leather case,
	though I also own an inexpensive waterproof case for use as necessary. I also own (though rarely use) an LG Nexus 5X,
	which I purchased discunt on eBay with the (hopefully still ongoing) plan to write a <a href="http://farcx.ev3.pw">FaRCX</a>
	Android app.
</p>

<h2>Server</h2>
<p>
	I run a couple of servers at home: One, on old HP desktop, runs
	<a href="http://FaRCX.ev3.pw">FaRCX</a>. The other is a late 2012 Mac mini (the same
	detailed in <a href="{{ site.url }}/personal/2015/03/28/setup.html">my previous setup
	article</a>) which I use for various personal purposes, including as a Plex server
	and to run various scripts. Both machines run Ubuntu Server, 14.04 LTS on the
	FaRCX machine and 16.04 LTS on the Mac mini.
