title: How I Compute
---
As a sort of a &#34;warm-up&#34; blog post, I thought I&#39;d write a little about the computing equipment I use.
Here it is, presented in no particular order. Links are to Amazon product pages where possible.

##Desktop
My desktop machine is a [base model late 2012 Mac mini][macmini]. This has a 2.5 GHz Ivy Bridge Core i5, and shipped with 4 GB of RAM and a 500 GB hard drive. I&#39;ve upgraded the machine with [8 GB of aftermarket RAM][ram] (for a total of 10GB) and a [240GB SanDisk Ultra II SSD][ssd]. It&#39;s driving a pair of [Dell 2407WFP-HC][disp] displays, each at a resolution of 1920x1200 pixels. These are supported by a [desk-mounted articulating stand][stand], allowing me to minutely adjust the position of the displays. In terms of peripherals, I use an [Apple Wired Keyboard][kb] and a [Logitech Marathon Mouse M705][mouse]. I also have an [Apple Magic Trackpad][tp], which is useful for when I bring the Mac mini downstaris to watch Formula One races on the television. At such times, I also make use of a [Microsoft Arc Wireless Keyboard][wkb]. I listen to audio from my computer using [Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphones][athm30]. All this and more rests on a pair of [Ergocraft Ashton L-shaped desks][desk] which I bought at steep discount from Staples.

Also on this desk is an Xbox 360 which is connected to one of the Dell displays via an [active HDMI to VGA adapter with audio][hdmi-vga].

##Laptop
My laptop is a [Late 2006 Black MacBook (model MA701LL/A)][macbook]. This has a 2.0 GHz Core 2 Duo (T7200), 2 GB of RAM, and a spinning hard drive of (I think) 200 GB. These days, I use it mostly for programming Vex robots using ROBOTC running under Windows 7 in Bootcamp.

##Mobile
My phone is a [Samsung Galaxy S3][gs3] running [CyanogenMod 11][cm11]. In addition to this, I have an [Asus/Google 2013 Nexus 7][n7], which runs stock Android 5.1. Occasionally I use [Panasonic RPTCM125K earbuds][buds] in conjunction with these devices.
